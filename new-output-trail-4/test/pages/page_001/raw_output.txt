# Data Collection : Tables

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[44, 135, 299, 150]]<|/det|>
(a) Each figure or table has a title and an informative caption.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[44, 164, 570, 180]]<|/det|>
(b) Each figure or table is self-sufficient and includes explanations of numbers used, replicates, units of measurement, labels, etc.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[44, 193, 934, 225]]<|/det|>
(c) Presentation of data allows for easy interpretation. Be Neat & Organized! It is okay to redraw original data tables used to collect data so they look better for presentation (Do this especially if you spilled liver juice on your paper!)

This data shows that plants gain more mass when there are fewer plants in a pot. All the seedlings had the same average mass (3.1 g) on the first day. The single seedling in a pot had a mass of 31.6 g after 15 days. The 5 seedlings in a pot had an average mass of 22.4 g after 15 days. The 10 seedlings in a pot and 15 seedlings in a pot had masses of 17.5 g and 12.4 g after 15 days.
