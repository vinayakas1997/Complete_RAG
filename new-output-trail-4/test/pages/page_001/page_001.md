## # Data Collection : Tables

(a) Each figure or table has a title and an informative caption.

(b) Each figure or table is self-sufficient and includes explanations of numbers used, replicates, units of measurement, labels, etc.

(c) Presentation of data allows for easy interpretation. Be Neat & Organized! It is okay to redraw original data tables used to collect data so they look better for presentation (Do this especially if you spilled liver juice on your paper!)

Example #1

<table><tr><td colspan="6">The Affect of Intraspecies Competition on the<br>Mass of Individual Corn Plants</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"># of Corn Seedlings per Poll</td><td colspan="4">Average Mass of Corn Plants (gram +/- 0.1 g)</td><td rowspan="2">Zabels & Nautis Listed!<br>Note that the<br>accuracy of the<br>balance beam is<br>listed!</td></tr><tr><td>Day 0</td><td>Day 5</td><td>Day 10</td><td>Day 15</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3.1</td><td>3.4</td><td>9.8</td><td>31.6</td><td rowspan="4">Note that significant<br>figures are maintained.<br>All decimal numbers<br>are rounded to<br>One-tenth of a gram!</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3.1</td><td>3.4</td><td>8.5</td><td>22.4</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>3.1</td><td>3.3</td><td>7.2</td><td>17.5</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>3.1</td><td>3.2</td><td>5.3</td><td>12.4</td></tr></table>

This data shows that plants gain more mass when there are fewer plants in a pot. All the seedlings had the same average mass (3.1 g) on the first day. The single seedling in a pot had a mass of 31.6 g after 15 days. The 5 seedlings in a pot had an average mass of 22.4 g after 15 days. The 10 seedlings in a pot and 15 seedlings in a pot had masses of 17.5 g and 12.4 g after 15 days.

Note that a description of the data in the table have been displayed!
